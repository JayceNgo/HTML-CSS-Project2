# HTML & CSS Project - Course Landing Page 🎯

## 📝 Introduction

This is a frontend project to design an online course landing page using HTML and CSS. The goal is to build a user-friendly, visually appealing, and well-structured interface — a great way to practice essential frontend skills.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Structure the web page content
-   **CSS3**: Layout, styling, and UI design
-   **Google Fonts**: Importing modern fonts
-   **Flexbox**: Flexible layout and alignment
-   **Responsive Design (basic)**: Using `viewport`, `%`, and `rem` for flexibility
-   **Custom Properties (CSS variables)**: Defining and reusing color variables like `--primary-color`

## 📚 Key Concepts Practiced

### 1. **HTML**

-   Utilized semantic elements like `header`, `main`, `footer`, `section`, and `nav` for clear content structure.
-   Used `alt` attributes for accessibility and SEO.
-   Included `link` and `meta` tags to optimize layout and load styles/fonts properly.

### 2. **CSS**

-   Set up global styles using `box-sizing` and a CSS reset file.
-   Customized components like buttons, cards, and navigation with **hover effects**, **border-radius**, and **box-shadows**.
-   Built layout structures using **Flexbox** for responsive, flexible design.
-   Created reusable components such as `.btn`, `.content`, and `.line-clamp`.

### 3. **Responsive Thinking**

-   Employed relative units like `rem`, `max-width`, and `calc()` to ensure flexible layout across devices.
-   Implemented the `meta viewport` tag to improve display on mobile devices.

### 4. **Modern UI Design**

-   Applied a primary color (`#ffb900`) paired with neutral backgrounds and text for contrast and visual hierarchy.
-   Each course card contains: image, title, description, rating, and price — making content easily scannable for users.

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**

-   Sticky navigation menu stays visible while scrolling.
-   Clear and consistent CTAs like “Book Now”, “Join Now”, and “Sign Up” are prominently displayed.
-   User testimonials (feedback carousel UI) help build trust and credibility.

## 📸 Page Structure

The site includes the following sections:

-   Header (Logo, Navigation, Call-to-Action)
-   Hero Section (Intro image, message, CTAs)
-   Popular Courses
-   Student Feedback
-   Platform Features
-   Blog Posts
-   Footer (Contact info, social media, useful links)
